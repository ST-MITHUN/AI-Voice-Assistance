## Voice Activated AI Assistant using GPT-3.5 Turbo

This project is a Voice-Controlled AI Assistant built with Python, integrating:
  -OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo for intelligent conversation
  -Speech Recognition for listening
  -Text-to-Speech (TTS) for speaking back responses
   The assistant listens for a wake word (“Hey”), then engages in conversation with natural voice responses.

 Features
  - Wake word activation ("Hey")
   -Speech-to-Text using Google Speech Recognition
   -AI-generated responses from OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo
   -Text-to-Speech response using pyttsx3 and espeak or gTTS
   -Continuous listening and interaction loop
   -Fun greetings and dynamic interaction personality

 Tech Stack
  -Python
  -OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API
  -SpeechRecognition (Google API)
  -pyttsx3 for text-to-speech
  -gTTS (optional)
  -dotenv for API key management
  -NumPy
  -Matplotlib (not used in this version but imported)
